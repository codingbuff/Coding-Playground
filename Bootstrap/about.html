        <h1>The Cat Gallery</h1>

        <h3>What this playground site explores</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this playground is to get familiar with the Bootstrap framework. I have made it to teach
            myself some of the
            features that Bootstrap offers. To do so, I made a simple gallery that looks at a small number of types of
            cat breeds to see
            what you can do with this tool. Some components/content that I demonstrate include:
        <ul>
            <li>Navbar</li>
            <li>Basic themes</li>
            <li>List groups</li>
            <li>Scaffolding</li>
            <li>Figures with images and captions</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Things I've Learned</h3>
        <p>Boostrap offers a convenient way to organize content so that you don't have to do much with the CSS yourself.
            Alot of the features
            come built-in which can easily be utilized by examining the Bootstrap <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/index.html" target="_blank"> documentaion</a>. The only styling
            I've done is a basic gradient background with
            all other typography done behind scenes by adding class names to the HTML attributes. Additionally, by
            taking advantage
            of the built-in Bootstrap grid system, you can make dynamic content that resizes based on the size of the
            window. This is drawn from flexbox
            but by adding some more
            class names you allow your site to automatically refit content to predetermind screen sizes that Bootstrap
            lays out without
            writing
            all of the CSS logic yourself. You can see how I implement this by resizing the windows on the separate
            tabs above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using all of this provides an alternative to creating
            user-friendly sites without having to do a lot of the grease work yourself. One downside I noticed is that
            it can sometimes be a pain
            to create customized styling. For example, Bootstrap designates a primary-color for many of its elements
            which can only be overridden
            through SCSS. This is certainly doable, but shows that there's a slight tradeoff between convenience and the
            ability to manipulate styling
            yourself, depending on what you're trying to do. There are certainly many other features I haven't
            played around with but am confident that it'll take just a little bit of reading on the documentaion for me
            to be able to
            figure out how to implement some of those other features.
        </p>
